Want To Help Your City? Good, we could use your help. We are a Code for America Brigade, which means we're volunteers that contribute our talents toward improving the way our local governments and community organizations use the web. Brigade is about action and you're here because you are someone who takes action. See what kind of things brigades do, or watch the inspirational TED talk given by Jennifer Pahlka, the founder of Code for America.
